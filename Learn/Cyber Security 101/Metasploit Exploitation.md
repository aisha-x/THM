# Task 2: Scanning


**Questions:**


**1- How many ports are open on the target system?**

first start `msfconsole` command to run metasploit framework command-line interface

port scan the target system using `nmap -sV <target ip>` to attempts to determine the version of the service running on port

Ans: ***5***

**2-Using the relevant scanner, what NetBIOS name can you see?**

you can search for NETBIOS module using ```search netbios```

then select the relevet module which is ```use auxiliary/scanner/netbios/nbname```

```show options``` then set the required paramters 

However, since we used the Nmap scanner to scan for open ports and determine the version running, we don't need to go through these steps. 

as you can see in the picture above in the version column for the netbios service 

Ans:  ***ACME IT SUPPORT***


**3-What is running on port 8000?**

if you want to use a module for scanning. use this module `use auxiliary/scanner/http/http_version` to scan for http version and set the required parameters.

in the picture above, you can see port 8000 open and the service running at is http with version  webfs/1.21 http 1.21

Ans: ***webfs/1.21***

**4- What is the “penny” user’s SMB password? Use the wordlist mentioned in the previous task.**

`search smb` to search for smb module 

`use  auxiliary/smb/smb_login` The smb_login module is used to bruteforce SMB remotely. SMB credentials are extra valuable because they are system credentials, and you can probably reuse some of them to log in to more machines. If you have a database plugin loaded, successful logins will be stored in it for future reference and usage.

then set the required parameters 

`set rhosts <target ip>`

`set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt`

`set SMBUser penny`

`run` to run the module
