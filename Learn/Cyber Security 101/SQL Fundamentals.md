# TASK 1: Introduction

Welcome, dear reader, to the fascinating, slightly chaotic, and deeply intertwined world of cybersecurity and databases. Imagine This: You’re diving into cybersecurity, and — surprise! — databases are everywhere. Whether you’re locking down a web app, analyzing threats in a Security Operations Center (SOC), or just trying to stop that overly curious user from seeing all the juicy data, databases are your trusty sidekick…or, occasionally, your arch-nemesis.

For the bold souls on the offensive side of security, databases are like a treasure chest just waiting for a clever SQL injection to crack it open.
