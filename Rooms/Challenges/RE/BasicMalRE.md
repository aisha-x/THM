## Strings 1

This executable prints an MD5 Hash on the screen when executed. Can you grab the exact flag?

Note: You don't need to run the executable!

```powershell
76b58619d2834419e82e0f6a605c8811
```

Open Ghidra and import the malware to CodeBrowser. We found part of the flag in the decompiled entry function

Double-click on the memory address 00424828 to send us to the flag

And here is the complete flag at the memory address 00424828

## Strings 2

The same thing for string2, I found the flag in the decompiled entry function

## Strings3

As for the last one, the entry function contained two functions: LoadSteringA and FindResources

referred to [Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-loadstringa), 

```cpp
int LoadStringA(
  [in, optional] HINSTANCE hInstance,
  [in]           UINT      uID,
  [out]          LPSTR     lpBuffer,
  [in]           int       cchBufferMax
);
```

This function `LoadStringA`loads a string from the executable file, and the parameter `uID`is the identifier of the string to be loaded, which in our case is 0x110 â†’ 272 in decimal. Go to the Program Trees tab, in the .rsrc section, which will contain resource information for a module, then search for the string ID 272
