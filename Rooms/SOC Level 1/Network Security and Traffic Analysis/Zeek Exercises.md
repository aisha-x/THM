- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40c3df3b-d5db-4f49-b20b-8d9c0da8abaa)

Ans: ***320***

### Q2. Investigate the conn.log file. What is the longest connection duration?

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d30890-92ee-42a7-8156-bbb50cfe28a7)

Ans: ***9.420791***


### Q3. Investigate the dns.log file. Filter all unique DNS queries. What is the number of unique domain queries?

- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb5df36-14a9-48ae-84c5-ae0399763621)
- `cat conn.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h service | awk  '/10.20.57.3/ && /10.10.2.21/' | grep "dns" | wc   `
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c09d968-e6c4-4773-ae58-06bb9cb0f1db)
