- File and Disk Utilities
- Networking Utilities
- Process Utilities
- Security Utilities
- System Information
- Miscellaneous

If you wish to download a tool or two but not the entire suite, you can navigate to [the Sysinternals Utilities Index page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/)

if you wish to run the tool from the web.--> https://live.sysinternals.com/

# File and Disk Utilities

## 1. Sigcheck

**Description:**  
Sigcheck is a command-line utility that shows detailed file information, including version, timestamp, and digital signatures. It can also query VirusTotal to check if a file is malicious.

**Example Command:**
```cmd
sigcheck -vt explorer.exe
```

[Sigcheck - Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck)

## 2. Streams
**Description:** 

Streams is a command-line utility that shows NTFS alternate data streams (ADS) attached to files. ADS can be used to hide metadata or malicious code. This tool can list and optionally delete them.

**Example Command:**
```cmd
streams -s -d C:\Users\YourName\Documents
```
This recursively deletes all ADS in the specified directory.

[Streams - Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams)

## 3. SDelete
**Description:**

SDelete securely deletes files or cleans free space to prevent recovery. It uses the DoD 5220.22-M standard for secure deletion, making it useful for wiping sensitive data.

**Example Command:**
```cmd
sdelete -p 3 -z C:
```
[SDelete - Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete)

## Answer the questions below

### Q1. There is a txt file on the desktop named file.txt. Using one of the three discussed tools in this task, what is the text within the ADS?

- use the stream tool to return the hidden file of the `file.txt`
 ```ps
streams C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\file.txt -accepteula  
```

- then change the directory to the file location `cd .\Desktop\`
- then use Notepad to view the contents of the hidden file
```ps
notepad.exe file.txt:ads.txt
```

- There is another way, to request all streams associate with `file.txt`
```ps
 get-item -Path .\file.txt -stream * 
```

# Networking Utilities

## 1. TCPView

**Description:**  
TCPView is a Windows Sysinternals utility that provides a real-time, detailed view of all TCP and UDP endpoints on your system. It displays local and remote addresses, ports, connection states, and the owning process name. It's a graphical and more intuitive alternative to the `netstat` command.

**Key Uses:**
- Monitor active network connections in real-time.
- Identify suspicious or unauthorized network activity.
- Detect malware attempting to call home.
- Troubleshoot application-level networking issues or port conflicts.

**Example Usage:**

To launch TCPView:

1. Download and extract the ZIP file from the official site.
2. Run `Tcpview.exe`.

**Command-line launch (from TCPView directory):**

```cmd
tcpview.exe
```

This opens the GUI, where you can:
- View current connections and their state (e.g., ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT).
- Sort by columns such as **Process**, **Remote Address**, or **State**.
- Right-click a connection to **Close Connection** or **Kill Process**.

**Official Resource:**
