### **General-Purpose Registers**

These are used for arithmetic, logic, and data movement.

| **Register** | **Meaning** | **Common Use** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **EAX** | Accumulator | Main register for arithmetic, logic, and function return values. |
| **EBX** | Base Register | Often used as a base pointer for memory access. |
| **ECX** | Counter | Used for loops and shift/rotate instructions (`loop`, `shl`, `shr`, etc.). |
| **EDX** | Data Register | Used in multiplication/division operations and I/O operations. |
| **ESI** | Source Index | Used for string and memory copy operations (source pointer). |
| **EDI** | Destination Index | Used for string and memory operations (destination pointer). |
| **EBP** | Base Pointer | Points to the base of the current stack frame (used in function calls). |
| **ESP** | Stack Pointer | Always points to the **top of the stack** (changes with `push` and `pop`). |

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Segment Registers**

Used to define memory segments (mainly in older x86 memory models).

| **Register** | **Meaning** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CS** | Code Segment | Points to the code (instructions) segment. |
| **DS** | Data Segment | Points to the data segment. |
| **SS** | Stack Segment | Points to the stack segment. |
| **ES, FS, GS** | Extra Segments | Additional data segments used for special purposes (e.g., thread-local storage). |

---

### üö© **EFLAGS Register (Flags Register)**

Holds status flags that reflect CPU operations (used for conditional jumps and decisions).

| **Flag** | **Abbreviation** | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Carry | CF | Set if there‚Äôs a carry or borrow after an arithmetic operation. |
| Parity | PF | Set if result has even number of 1 bits. |
| Auxiliary | AF | Used for BCD arithmetic (rare). |
| Zero | ZF | Set if the result is zero. |
| Sign | SF | Set if the result is negative (MSB = 1). |
| Overflow | OF | Set if signed overflow occurs. |
| Direction | DF | Controls string processing direction. |
| Interrupt | IF | Enables or disables interrupts. |
